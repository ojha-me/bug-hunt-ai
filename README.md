The Big Idea
Traditional code learning can be passive. You read, you watch, and then you try to apply it. BugHunt AI flips the script. Learning happens inside a conversation with an AI tutor.

Instead of just getting static code blocks, the AI provides live, editable, and runnable code editors right in the chat. You can ask a question, get a concept explained with code, and immediately tweak and run that code to see how it works.

The real magic happens when the AI gives you a challenge: a snippet of code with a subtle bug. Your mission is to find it, fix it, and submit it back for review. It's an active, engaging, and powerful way to truly understand code.

‚ú® Key Features
Conversational Learning: Chat with a Gemini-powered AI that acts as your personal code tutor.
Interactive Code Snippets: When the AI sends code, it appears in a fully-functional Monaco editor instance within the chat thread.
In-Browser Execution: Run and test code snippets safely in a sandboxed environment without leaving your browser.
AI-Generated Challenges: The AI generates unique coding problems with bugs for you to solve.
Real-Time Code Review: Submit your fix and get instant feedback, hints, and explanations from the AI.

üöÄ How It Works
Start a Conversation: Ask the AI to explain a concept, like "What is a promise in JavaScript?".
Get Interactive Code: The AI responds with an explanation and a runnable code snippet in an editor.
Play & Tweak: You can edit and run the code directly in the chat to solidify your understanding.
Receive a Challenge: The AI presents you with a new code snippet that contains a bug.
Hunt the Bug: Find the error, fix the code, and submit your solution.
Get Instant Feedback: The AI reviews your code and tells you if you succeeded or gives you a hint if you're stuck.
